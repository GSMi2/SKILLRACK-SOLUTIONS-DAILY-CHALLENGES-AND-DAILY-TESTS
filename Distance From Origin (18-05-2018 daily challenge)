Distance From Origin

A point in a graph (x,y) is given as input. The program must print the distance between the given point and the origin with precision up to two decimal places.

Boundary Condition(s):
1 <= x, y <= 100

Input Format:
The first line contains the value of x and y separated by space(s).

Output Format:
The first line contains the distance with precision up to two decimal places.

Example Input/Output 1:
Input:
3 3

Output:
4.24

Example Input/Output 2:
Input:
4 0

Output:
4.00
