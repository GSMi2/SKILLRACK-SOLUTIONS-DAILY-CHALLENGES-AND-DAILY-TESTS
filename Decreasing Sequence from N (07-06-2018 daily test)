Decreasing Sequence from N

Two integers N and D are passed as input. The program must print the decreasing sequence from N to 1 with common difference D.

Boundary Condition(s):
2 <= N <= 9999999
1 <= D <= 9999999

Input Format:
The first line contains N and D separated by space(s).

Output Format:
The first line contains integers separated by a space.

Example Input/Output 1:
Input:
20 3

Output:
17 14 11 8 5 2

Example Input/Output 2:
Input:
26 5

Output:
21 16 11 6 1
